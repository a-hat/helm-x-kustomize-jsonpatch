# helm-x-kustomize-jsonpatch
Test Case for helm x

Run `run.sh` to see the template generated by helm x

The output on my machine is

~~~~
# Source: release-name/templates/0-kustomized.yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test
spec:
  rules:
  - host: should be replaced by helm x
  - host: www.test.com
~~~~

It is expected that both `host` fields are replaced.
